This project is a Banking Management System built using Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and an H2 in-memory database. It provides a complete backend and frontend interface for managing core banking operations. The application includes essential entities such as Account, Transaction, Customer, Bank, Branch, and Employee, enabling smooth handling of customer and employee interactions. It also integrates Spring Security for user role–based authentication, ensuring that each user (Admin, Employee, or Customer) can only access features relevant to their profile. This project demonstrates secure session management, CRUD operations, and dynamic UI rendering using Thymeleaf templates — all within a lightweight, production-ready Spring Boot environment.
